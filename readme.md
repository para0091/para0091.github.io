For the Web Portfolio assignment, I decided to use Bootstrap just for the home page and custom HTML and CSS for the rest of the pages. It was easy to set up Bootstrap, but I was not able to overwrite the colors at first. So I decided to reach out to the Professor and he told me to use another class to set new colors. Another problem was that I was not able to add my logo to the navbar after I set the navigation without it first. Then I found out that I could simply use a navbar-brand class to do that. Everything else with Bootstrap was straightforward as I used columns and spacing classes pretty effectively. I also used the navbar for every page as I wanted to keep it consistent. But I also added a custom navigation in the footer. Another thing I wanted to think about was the animations. For the prototype assignment, I felt that I had done too many over-the-top animations and decided to use subtle and simple animations for this assignment. As I had practiced grid and flexbox quite a lot, it was very easy to use them for this assignment. I was able to create layouts simply. I was able to use the icons from Fontawesome for all my social media links in the contact page and footer. Overall, it was a fun assignment and I am really happy to have created my own portfolio site.

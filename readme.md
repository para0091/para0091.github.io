1. Bootstrap Navigation
2. Overwriting Bootstrap Colors
    This was quite confusing and I had to ask Professor Rob for assistance. I saw that they had used SASS for all their CSS work, and I had to use SASS to overwrite the default values. I had no idea to use SASS. So Rob told me to use new classes to overwrite default bootstrap.
3. The navbar was not showing the logo when I added it after setting it up.

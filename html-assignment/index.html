            <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am Fuad Saneen and I was born and raised in the beautiful state of Kerala in India. I completed 12<sup>th</sup> grade in 2018. I have always loved creating all kinds of designs and tinkering with computer software. In addition, I am interested in all areas of design, whether it be interactive, product or architectural. I have been using Adobe programs and trying out HTML and CSS since I was 14 and I am positive that I can create a good career for myself, with the help of my knowledge in these areas. Therefore, I believe that taking the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program will propel me towards my goals and ambitions as this program touches on all aspects of Interactive Design.
            <br>
            Not only am I a quick learner, but also a disciplined student and I am sure that these abilities will help me achieve great academic success. As for professional experience, I have been working as a <em>Graphic Designer</em> for the past year and I am looking forward to learning coding, so that I can add it to my skillset and increase my value. Apart from that, I am a huge soccer fan. When I’m not creating stuff, you will see me watching and playing soccer matches in the neighbourhood, reading interesting books and watching classic movies.

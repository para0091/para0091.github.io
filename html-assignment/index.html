            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am Fuad Saneen and I was born and raised in the beautiful state of Kerala in India. I completed
                12<sup>th</sup> grade in 2018. I have always loved creating all kinds of designs and tinkering with
                computer software. In addition, I am interested in all areas of design, whether it be interactive,
                product or architectural. I have been using Adobe programs and trying out HTML and CSS since I was 14
                and I am positive that I can create a good career for myself, with the help of my knowledge in these
                areas. Therefore, I believe that taking the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program
                will propel me towards my goals and ambitions as this program touches on all aspects of Interactive
                Design.
                <br>
                Not only am I a quick learner, but also a disciplined student and I am sure that these abilities will
                help me achieve great academic success. As for professional experience, I have been working as a
                <em>Graphic Designer</em> for the past year and I am looking forward to learning coding, so that I can
                add it to my skillset and increase my value.Apart from that, I am a huge soccer fan.</p>
                Some of my hobbies include:

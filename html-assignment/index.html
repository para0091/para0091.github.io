            I am Fuad Saneen and I am the small package that good things come in. I was born and raised in the beautiful state of Kerala in India. I have always loved creating all kinds of designs and tinkering with computer software. In addition, I am interested in all areas of design, whether it be interactive, product or architectural. I have been using Adobe programs since I was 14 and I am positive that I can create a good career for myself from my experience with those tools. Therefore, I believe that taking the Interactive Media Design program will propel me towards my goals and ambitions as this program touches on all aspects of Interactive Design. Not only am I a quick learner, but also a disciplined student and I am sure that these abilities will help me achieve great academic success. As for professional experience, I have been working as a Graphic Designer for the past year and I am looking forward to improving my communication skills as I have been struggling with it throughout my job. Apart from that, I am a huge soccer fan. When Iâ€™m not creating stuff, you will see me watching and playing soccer matches in the neighbourhood, reading interesting books and watching classic movies.
